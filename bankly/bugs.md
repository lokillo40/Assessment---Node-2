## Bug #1:
In the `/login` route, the line `let user = User.authenticate(username, password);` is missing an `await` keyword. Since `User.authenticate` is likely an asynchronous function (based on the common patterns of authentication), not awaiting its completion could cause unpredictable behavior.

## Bug #2:
In the `router.delete('/:username')` route, the line `User.delete(req.params.username);` is missing an `await` keyword. As this is likely an asynchronous operation (given the nature of database operations), not awaiting its completion could lead to unpredictable behavior, especially if subsequent operations depend on its result.

## Bug #3:
In the `static async get(username)` method, when the user is not found, an `ExpressError` with a message 'No such user' and status code 404 is created but not thrown. This means that even if the user does not exist, the function will not raise an error, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Bug #4:
The `authUser` function decodes the token without verifying its signature. This is a security vulnerability because it allows attackers to create their own tokens and impersonate any user.

## Bug #5:
In the `static async register(...)` method, the user's password is hashed and then stored in the database. However, when returning the newly registered user, the hashed password is also returned. This could be a security concern as it exposes sensitive information. While the hashed password isn't the plaintext password, it's still not ideal to expose it.

## Bug #6:
The `/auth/login` route does not validate that both the `username` and `password` fields are provided in the request body. Without this validation, missing fields will cause the application to fail at a later stage, resulting in a generic 500 error instead of a more informative
